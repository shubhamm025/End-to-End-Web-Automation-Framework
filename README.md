# ðŸ§ª Custom Python Test Automation Framework

A robust, extensible **Python test automation framework** combining **Pytest**, **Page Object Model (POM)**, and an optional **Keyword-Driven Layer** to deliver scalable and maintainable UI automation.  

Built by [Shubham Motwani](https://github.com/shubhamm025) to **showcase best practices** in modern QA automation and provide a template for real-world projects.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This framework solves the common problem of brittle, unorganized UI automation by combining:
- **Pytest** for lightweight test execution and fixture management.
- **Page Object Model (POM)** for clean separation of UI logic.
- **Optional Keyword-Driven Layer** for reusable, high-level business flows.
- **Allure reporting** for rich, interactive test reports.
- **Cross-browser support** to ensure reliability across environments.

Itâ€™s designed to be:
- **Extensible** â€“ easy to add new pages, keywords, or test suites.
- **Readable** â€“ test cases remain concise and business-focused.
- **Maintainable** â€“ clear separation of responsibilities.
